# simple-text-finder

This is a simple program that finds text in folders.

I wanted to know which file used a specific function in multiple folders, but IDE didn't support that task, so I made this.


Input : path, string to search

Output : path(where the text you are searching), line number(based on text file)


This program searches all files in the path.
